# Full Stack Web Developer Path
This is a guide to learn full-stack web development. It is focused on full-stack JavaScript. It covers all the way from the fundamentals to React and Node. <br>
The idea behind this repo is, to have a place to log the learning process in an organized way.  <br><br>
This can be used as a companion to [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum

## Extra Goals
* Learn to setup your own local developement environment
* Deploy completed projects using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [surge.sh](http://surge.sh/) (Both front-end only) Or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) (Works with back-end too)
* Learn about build tools like [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) and include them in projects
* Learn about linting. Use linters like [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for Javascript , [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for CSS in your projects.
* Learn about CSS conventions like [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/), [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/book/).
* Every week, write a medium post about that week's learnings.
* Make a habit of coding daily. Try [#100DaysofCode Challenge](http://100daysofcode.com/)
