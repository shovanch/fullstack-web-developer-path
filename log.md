**Target** : ***Learn and Code for at least 5 hours everyday for 30 days***

**Start Date** : 30 October 2017 (Today is 1 November)

Day : One hundred and something
------
**Today's Progress** : Today I continued learning React, will set aside Angular for now. Yesterday I completed the Intro to Javascript on Codecademy, but there's another one that's the main one or something? I don't know...but I'll be completing that one too. Also, my mentor suggested that I use Code School, which I will look into.

**Thoughts** : I'm  nervous, because I want to build things and get a job, but there's so much to learn and build...I just want to stay focused on growing as a developer and not get caught up in rabbit-holing

**Link to work** : N/A

**Thing(s) learned**: JavaScript basics, intro to React and Angular
